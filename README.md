# BikeStores-Dashboard
1. I first created a MySQL Database 'BikeStores'. <br>
2. Then I created the tables which are in the file 'bikestores_create_objects_mysql'.<br>
3. Then I entered data into those tables which is in the file ' bikestores_load_data_mysql_clean_utf8'.<br>
4. Data Table required for dashboard is extracted through 'BikeStores.sql' file<br>
5. I used python to export the SQL data to Excel file using mysql.connector module in python.<br>
6. Then I created Pivot Tables and dashboard in excel.<br>
7. Lastly I used this excel file as data source for creating a more representable and interactive dashboard in Tableau.<br>
